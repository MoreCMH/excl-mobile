# Introduction to ExCL #
ExCL is a platform that enables museums to engage visitors at museum activities through the use of 
a mobile application. Content is managed through a WordPress content management system by museum 
staff, and visitors will download the customized ExCL app, written using Appceleratorâ€™s Titanium, 
to their mobile device. ExCL is also intended to be used by museums on kiosk devices and provides 
a kiosk mode for this purpose.

This documentation is intended for ExCL developers and details the steps to setup and enhance both 
the content management system and the mobile application. We will describe both the WordPress and 
the Titanium technical details, followed by tips on using a continuous integration build server and 
deploying to the app stores.
